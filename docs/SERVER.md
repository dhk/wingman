# Wingman on an always-on Ubuntu server

The deployment this guide builds: one Linux box that owns the workspace,
runs `wingman overnight` on a timer, keeps the MCP server up as a service,
and is reachable from claude.ai (web, desktop, phone) over your Tailscale
network. Your career data still lives on a machine you own — this is
local-first with a longer extension cord, not hosting (RFC-002 holds; the
hosted tiers remain a separate, parked decision).

Everything here is Ubuntu 22.04+/Debian-family; adjust package commands
for other distros.

## 1. Install

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git nodejs npm   # node only for PDF exports
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh          # uv, if not present
git clone https://github.com/dhk/wingman.git ~/wingman
cd ~/wingman && uv tool install .
wingman --version
```

The workspace defaults to `~/.local/share/wingman` (XDG). Set
`WINGMAN_DATA_DIR` before `wingman init` if you want it elsewhere —
consistently, including inside the systemd units below.

## 2. Keys (env vars — the Keychain is macOS-only)

`wingman keys` requires macOS's `security` binary and fails visibly on
Linux; the RFC-019 resolution order ("environment wins") makes env vars
the Linux path. Put them in an environment file the services will share:

```bash
install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.config/wingman.env
cat >> ~/.config/wingman.env <<'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-...
EOF
```

For interactive shells, also `set -a; source ~/.config/wingman.env; set +a`
from `~/.profile` (or export them your preferred way).

## 3. Migrate the workspace from a Mac (optional)

The workspace is fully self-contained, so migration is one backup:

```bash
# on the Mac
wingman backup
scp "$HOME/Library/Application Support/wingman/backups/"<newest>.tar.gz server:

# on the server
wingman init
wingman restore ~/<newest>.tar.gz
wingman status && wingman doctor
```

## 4. Overnight on a systemd timer

`~/.config/systemd/user/wingman-overnight.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Wingman overnight run (RFC-018)

[Service]
Type=oneshot
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/wingman.env
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/wingman overnight
```

`~/.config/systemd/user/wingman-overnight.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run wingman overnight every morning

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 05:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Enable it, and let user services run without a login session:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now wingman-overnight.timer
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"    # services survive logout/reboot
systemctl --user list-timers           # confirm the next run
```

`Persistent=true` means a missed 05:00 (box was off) fires on next boot.
Logs: `journalctl --user -u wingman-overnight.service`.

## 5. The MCP server as a service

`~/.config/systemd/user/wingman-mcp.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Wingman MCP server (streamable HTTP, RFC-017)
After=network.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/wingman.env
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/wingman-mcp --http
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now wingman-mcp.service
```

This serves `http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp/<token>` — loopback only, by
design. The token lives in `<workspace>/mcp-http-token` (0600); it is the
credential, treat it like one. `wingman-mcp --rotate-token` mints a new
one (then restart the service and update any connector).

## 6. Reach it from claude.ai via Tailscale

Install Tailscale (`https://tailscale.com/download/linux`), `sudo
tailscale up`, then publish the loopback port with TLS:

```bash
sudo tailscale serve --bg 8787        # HTTPS inside your tailnet only
# or, only if you need it reachable off-tailnet (e.g. claude.ai web):
sudo tailscale funnel --bg 8787       # public HTTPS, guarded by the token
```

The server keeps DNS-rebinding protection on and must therefore accept
the tunnel's Host header (#100). It auto-detects this machine's Tailscale
name at startup, so the setup above needs nothing extra — but if the
service can start before `tailscaled` is up (add `After=tailscale.service`
to the unit to avoid that), or another proxy fronts the port, pin the
hostname explicitly: `wingman-mcp --http --allowed-host my.front.example`
(repeatable), or `WINGMAN_ALLOWED_HOSTS=a.example,b.example` in
`wingman.env`. The startup banner lists the accepted names.

Your endpoint is `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp/<token>` (token from
`cat "$(wingman status | sed -n 's/^Data dir: //p')/mcp-http-token"` or
just read the file in your workspace).

In claude.ai: Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste that
URL. The same URL works in Claude Desktop and the Claude mobile apps once
the connector is added to your account.

**The trade, plainly:** `serve` keeps the endpoint inside your tailnet —
strongest posture, but claude.ai's servers can't reach it, so it only
serves clients on your own devices that route through the tailnet.
`funnel` makes the endpoint publicly reachable and the path token becomes
the only lock: rotate it if a URL ever leaks (browser history, pasted
logs), and remember wingman's access-log silencing (#70) exists precisely
so the token never lands in logs. If funnel makes you uneasy, that's the
signal to revisit the hosted-tier assessment instead.

## 7. Care and feeding

- **Backups:** `wingman backup` is one command; add a second user timer
  (weekly) if the box is the workspace's only home. Tarballs land in
  `<workspace>/backups/`, pruned to keep-N.
- **Updates:** `cd ~/wingman && git pull && uv tool install --reinstall .`
  then `systemctl --user restart wingman-mcp.service`.
- **Telemetry:** `wingman telemetry on` once, if you want the usage
  journal; it is per-workspace and local-only (RFC-023).
- **Sanity:** `wingman doctor` after any change; it reports version, keys
  seen (env), and workspace health.

## 8. The web UI

The HTTP server also serves `https://…/ui/<token>/` (RFC-033/034):
today's digest, every report, an upload form for LinkedIn exports and
resumes, and the validated API-key form — the no-terminal onboarding
path for a second user (see `MULTI-INSTANCE-DESIGN.md`). Same token,
same tunnel, nothing extra to run; the startup banner prints the URL.

**Virtual folders for multiple instances.** One hostname can front every
instance as `/dhk/…`, `/trent/…` — two ways, and they must not be
combined (the prefixes would stack):

*Native prefix (preferred — the server owns its folder):* each instance
listens on its path itself, so any pass-through front (nginx, Caddy,
direct tailnet access to the port) works with no path rewriting:

```ini
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/wingman-mcp --http --port 8788 --prefix /trent
```

*Tailscale path mounts (no other proxy needed):* `tailscale serve
--set-path` **strips** the mount segment before forwarding, so with this
front the instances run WITHOUT `--prefix`:

```bash
sudo tailscale serve --bg --set-path /dhk   http://127.0.0.1:8787
sudo tailscale serve --bg --set-path /trent http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

Either way each person's bookmark is
`https://<host>…/<name>/ui/<their-token>/` and their MCP connector URL is
`…/<name>/mcp/<their-token>`; the UI emits only relative URLs, so pages
work identically under both fronts. The path segment is a label, not a
boundary — the token (and, under `serve`, tailnet membership) is still
the credential; isolation remains the Unix user + workspace, per the
multi-instance design.
